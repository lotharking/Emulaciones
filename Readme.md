# Emulations
The following project was an approach to modeling aimed at implementing control systems for various power generation systems. It was presented as part of an undergraduate thesis, which was itself a component of a project to create a microgrid using `renewable energies`. Please note that the information presented here is only an approximation, and for more detailed information, you should refer to the [thesis itself](http://red.uao.edu.co//handle/10614/12609).

**Note**: Please be aware that the comments in the code are currently in Spanish because that was the original language used during the development of the project and the referenced thesis. However, future updates aim to improve consistency for better readability.

# Requirements
- C language
- Raspberry pi
- Arduino Due

# How to use
To run this project, it is recommended to execute it on a Raspberry Pi system, as the code was developed with this in mind. This recommendation stems from the usage of system ports to read the variables sensed by the sensors. In this project, control is generated by the Arduino Due, which must be connected to the Raspberry Pi. Once the connections are correctly made, you should start both projects to observe their proper functioning.

This modeling can be employed as a control signal for a three-phase inverter and effectively emulate the behavior of such energy systems. For further information, please refer to the associated thesis.
